Frameworks and Language Used:
-
Java: Java is a popular programming language that was used to write the application logic for this portal. Java is an object-oriented language that is widely used in web development, and it was a good choice for this project because of its strong type checking, object-oriented features, and built-in support for database connectivity.

Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a popular framework for building web applications in Java. It was used in this project to simplify the setup of the application, configure the database connection, and manage the various dependencies used in the project.

Hibernate: Hibernate is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Java. It was used in this project to map the Java objects to the database tables, handle the persistence of objects to the database, and manage the relationships between objects.

MySQL: MySQL is a popular open-source database management system. It was used in this project as the database to store the data for the various models.

Maven: Maven is a popular build automation tool for Java projects. It was used in this project to manage the various dependencies and build the project.

Data Flow and Functionality in Controller, Services, and Repository:
-
Controller:
The controller package contains classes that handle HTTP requests and responses. The functions used in the controller are as follows:

Create:
createStudent(StudentDTO studentDTO): This function creates a new Student entity using the provided StudentDTO and returns the created entity as a response.

createLaptop(LaptopDTO laptopDTO): This function creates a new Laptop entity using the provided LaptopDTO and returns the created entity as a response.

createCourse(CourseDTO courseDTO): This function creates a new Course entity using the provided CourseDTO and returns the created entity as a response.

createBook(BookDTO bookDTO): This function creates a new Book entity using the provided BookDTO and returns the created entity as a response.

Read:
getAllStudents(): This function returns a list of all Student entities in the database.

getStudentById(String id): This function returns the Student entity with the specified ID.

getAllLaptops(): This function returns a list of all Laptop entities in the database.

getLaptopById(String id): This function returns the Laptop entity with the specified ID.

getAllCourses(): This function returns a list of all Course entities in the database.

getCourseById(String id): This function returns the Course entity with the specified ID.

getAllBooks(): This function returns a list of all Book entities in the database.

getBookById(String id): This function returns the Book entity with the specified ID.

Update:
updateStudent(String id, StudentDTO studentDTO): This function updates the Student entity with the specified ID using the provided StudentDTO and returns the updated entity as a response.

updateLaptop(String id, LaptopDTO laptopDTO): This function updates the Laptop entity with the specified ID using the provided LaptopDTO and returns the updated entity as a response.

updateCourse(String id, CourseDTO courseDTO): This function updates the Course entity with the specified ID using the provided CourseDTO and returns the updated entity as a response.

updateBook(String id, BookDTO bookDTO): This function updates the Book entity with the specified ID using the provided BookDTO and returns the updated entity as a response.

Delete:
deleteStudent(String id): This function deletes the Student entity with the specified ID from the database.

deleteLaptop(String id): This function deletes the Laptop entity with the specified ID from the database.

deleteCourse(String id): This function deletes the Course entity with the specified ID from the database.

deleteBook(String id): This function deletes the Book entity with the specified ID from the database.

Service:
The service package contains classes that perform business logic for each entity. The functions used in the service are as follows:

Create:
createStudent(StudentDTO studentDTO): This function creates a new Student entity using the provided StudentDTO and returns the created entity.

createLaptop(LaptopDTO laptopDTO): This function creates a new Laptop entity using the provided LaptopDTO and returns the created entity.

createCourse(CourseDTO courseDTO): This function creates a new Course entity using the provided CourseDTO and returns the created entity.

createBook(BookDTO bookDTO): This function creates a new Book entity using the provided BookDTO and returns the created entity.

Read:
getAllStudents(): This function returns a list of all Student entities in the database.

getStudentById(String id): This function returns the Student entity with the specified ID.

getAllLaptops(): This function returns a list of all Laptop entities in the database.

getLaptopById(String id): This function returns the Laptop entity with the specified ID.

getAllCourses(): This function returns a list of all Course entities in the database.

Project Summary:
-
The project aims to develop a portal for managing various relationships between models such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. The models involved in the project are Student, Laptop, Course, Book, and Address.

The Student model contains information such as student ID, name, age, phone number, branch, department, and address. The address field is an embedded model that includes information such as landmark, zipcode, district, state, and country.

The Laptop model contains details such as laptop ID, name, brand, price, and a one-to-one relationship with the Student model.

The Course model includes fields such as course ID, title, description, duration, and a many-to-many relationship with the Student model.

The Book model consists of book ID, title, author, description, price, and a many-to-one relationship with the Student model.

The Address model contains details such as landmark, zipcode, district, state, and country.

CRUD operations have been implemented for each model, including create, read, update, and delete functionalities. The project architecture includes the controller, services, and repository layers, and the data flow includes the request being made from the controller, then sent to the services, which processes the data and communicates with the repository to access or modify the data in the database.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive portal for managing various models' relationships and information in a structured and efficient manner.
